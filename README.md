## Business Context
With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, a Superstore Giant would like to design a customer loyalty program that strengthens its relationship with its' customers and incentivizes repeat purchases. The objective of the loyalty program is to increase customer retention and drive incremental sales by targeting customers with personalized promotional offers. The company's marketing manager has proposed to implement a tier-based marketing campaign where customers are offered cash rewards as incentives towards their first purchase following enrollment into the loyalty program. The proposed cash reward offers are as follows:

Get $200 on first purchase

Get $100 on first purchase

Get $25 on first purchase

The Superstore Giant is seeking your knowledge in identifying which customers should get what offer as this requires understanding the customers' buying behaviors. You have been provided access to the customer transaction database contained in the Superstore.csv file and asked to provide valuable insights into customer behavior by grouping customers into different segments based on their buying behavior and loyalty to the business.

To help guide your analysis, perform a value-based customer segmentation analysis (also known as RFM Segmentation) using customers' transaction histories to group the customer base into different value segments. The final output of your analysis should be a table containing customer Ids, customer value segment and your cash reward recommendation.

As part of your effort to support the marketing team in the personalization of promotional offers, consider a predictive analytics approach which takes into account the total expected profit from a customer in the value ranking. The marketing team would like to know how much profit could be expected from each customer in the next one year of transactions
