#The California Housing dataset is a well-known dataset used for regression tasks, especially in machine learning. 
It was originally derived from the 1990 U.S. Census data and is often used to predict housing prices in different districts of California.



## Overview of the California Housing Dataset
Purpose: Predict the median house value for California districts.
Target Variable: median_house_value (continuous variable in USD).
Number of Instances: 20,640 rows (districts).
Number of Features: 8 predictive features + 1 target variable

###Features in the Dataset
Feature Name	Description
MedInc	Median income in the district (in tens of thousands of dollars).
HouseAge	Median age of the houses in the district.
AveRooms	Average number of rooms per household.
AveBedrms	Average number of bedrooms per household.
Population	Total population of the district.
AveOccup	Average number of occupants per household.
Latitude	Geographical coordinate (north-south position).
Longitude	Geographical coordinate (east-west position).
median_house_value	(Target Variable) Median house price in the district (in USD).

####Project Overview
Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn to model housing prices.
Explored and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and feature scaling.
Evaluated model performance using RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualized key relationships between features and house prices.
